**E-Commerce Project Readme**

**Project Overview:**
This e-commerce project aims to create a comprehensive database schema and populate it with sample data relevant to an online shopping platform. The schema includes tables for user information, login credentials, product categories, customer profiles, products, and shopping carts. Sample data has been inserted to demonstrate the functionality of the schema.

**Files Included:**
1. **Database Creation Script:** The SQL script (`create_tables.sql`) contains commands to create the database tables with their respective fields and primary keys.
2. **Data Insertion Script:** The SQL script (`insert_data.sql`) contains commands to insert sample data into the tables created by the database creation script.
3. **Readme File:** This file (`README.md`) provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the scripts, and explanations of the database schema and sample data.

**Instructions:**
1. **Database Creation:** Run the SQL script `create_tables.sql` to create the necessary tables in your preferred SQL database management system.
2. **Data Insertion:** Run the SQL script `insert_data.sql` to insert sample data into the created tables.
3. **Database Usage:** Once the tables are created and populated with sample data, you can use the database for testing and development purposes.

**Database Schema:**
1. **user_upload:** Contains user IDs.
2. **Login:** Stores user login information.
3. **category:** Holds product categories and descriptions.
4. **customer_profile:** Stores customer information and order details.
5. **product:** Contains product details such as category, ID, name, color, brand, and price.
6. **cart:** Tracks the items added to the shopping cart.
7. **headphones, smartwatches, computer_accessories, Speaker, camera_accessories, Laptops:** Additional tables specific to product categories, each containing product details.

**Sample Data:**
The sample data provided in the `insert_data.sql` script includes user IDs, login credentials, product categories, product details, and customer profiles. It demonstrates how data can be inserted into the database tables to represent users, products, and transactions in an e-commerce platform.

**Note:** Modify the sample data and schema as needed to suit your specific requirements and use case.
